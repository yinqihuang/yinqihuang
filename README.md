<h3> Virtual Reality ‚Ä¢ Spatial Navigation ‚Ä¢ Decision Making </h3>

My overarching goal is to investigate human memory in a naturalistic environment using computational models. I am a big fan of naturalistic stimuli because they contain rich and dynamic information, similar to what we receive in the real world. Read more about [naturalistic stimuli](https://naturalistic-data.org/content/intro.html) in this notebook written by Dr. Luke Chang, Dr. Emily Finn, and Dr. Jeremy Manning.

Currently, I am studying the decision making in spatial navigation in a virtual environment, co-advised by Dr. Arne Ekstrom and Dr. Robert Wilson. Read more about why VR is naturalistic in my notes on [Spatial Cognitive Map](https://yinqi-h.gitbook.io/ml-models/neuroscience-paper/spatial-cognitive-map).

My undergraduate project on investigating the impact of time and event boundaries on episodic memory using movie stimuli, advised by Dr. Morgan Barense, was presented at Context and Episodic Memory Symposium and Lake Ontario Visionary Establishment.
