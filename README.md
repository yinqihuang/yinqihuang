<h3> Virtual Reality ‚Ä¢ Spatial Navigation ‚Ä¢ Decision Making </h3>

My overarching goal is to investigate human memory in a naturalistic environment using computational models. I am a big fan of naturalistic stimuli because they contain rich and dynamic information, similar to what we receive in the real world. Read more about [naturalistic stimuli](https://naturalistic-data.org/content/intro.html) in this notebook written by Dr. Luke Chang, Dr. Emily Finn, and Dr. Jeremy Manning.

Currently, I am studying the decision making in spatial navigation in a virtual environment, co-advised by Dr. Arne Ekstrom and Dr. Robert Wilson. Read more about why VR is naturalistic in my notes on [Spatial Cognitive Map](https://yinqi-h.gitbook.io/ml-models/neuroscience-paper/spatial-cognitive-map).

My undergraduate project on investigating the impact of time and event boundaries on episodic memory using movie stimuli, advised by Dr. Morgan Barense, was presented at Context and Episodic Memory Symposium and Lake Ontario Visionary Establishment.

<h3> Orangesoft Women in Technology Scholarship Essay </h3>
I recently applied for the Orangesoft Women in Technology Scholarship. Below is the essay I submitted as part of my application:
  
Dear Orangesoft Women in Technology Scholarship Committee,

I am writing to express my sincere interest in the Orangesoft Women in Technology Scholarship.  I am Yinqi Huang, a first-year Ph.D. student in Psychology, with a minor in Applied Math at the University of Arizona. With a passionate commitment to using multi-sensory data and computational models for advancing brain health and neurodegenerative research, I believe that my academic achievements, leadership skills, coupled with my commitment to fostering an inclusive work environment make me a strong candidate for this scholarship.

My academic journey began at the University of Toronto, where I earned an Honors B.Sc. in Psychology, with a minor in Biology. My interest in brain research took root and manifested in my active involvement in assisting graduate students' research projects from the first year of my undergraduate study. Parallel to my studies, I embraced leadership roles that emphasize diversity and inclusion, as I recognize their significance in the tech industry.

Leading iGEM Toronto, a bioengineering student research team, I took the initiative to implement inclusive hiring practices that catalyzed diversity and triumphs. Through attending workshops, I educated our leadership team on unconscious bias, thus cultivating a work culture where diverse ideas flourished. We won two gold medals in international iGEM competitions in [2019 (wiki)](https://2019.igem.org/Team:Toronto) and [2022 wiki](https://2022.igem.wiki/toronto/team), highlighting the benefits of fostering a diverse and inclusive work culture. Furthermore, my mentorship paved the way for two aspiring female web developers to secure internships and pursue graduate studies at the University of Toronto, offering them opportunities to advance their careers in technology. These practices reflect my commitment to shaping an inclusive, collaborative, and innovative work environment by leveraging diverse talents.

Upon earning my B.Sc., I transitioned to an industry project that integrated machine learning and developmental psychology to evaluate developmental milestones in young children. As the only female member of the team, my contributions include drafting a 13,000 CAD grant proposal for the Scientific Research & Experimental Development federal program, implementing Bayesian algorithms using Python, diagnosed and resolved performance bottlenecks in our Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) model to boost test accuracy from 73% to 78%. Moreover, incorporating my expertise in Psychology, I analyzed the company‚Äôs personalized learning strategies and offered valuable insights to user experience designers. These endeavors demonstrate my technical skills and adaptability, while also highlighting the need for greater female representation in the technology sector.

Currently, as a Ph.D. student, my research is probing the neural mechanisms underlying spatial navigation, particularly in the context of aging and neurodegenerative disorders. Motivated by my grandmother‚Äôs battle with Alzheimer‚Äôs, my vision is to translate laboratory research into practical, tangible solutions. With an emphasis on creating computational models for the early detection of Alzheimer‚Äôs through navigation pattern analysis, my scholarly contributions have been recognized including the Best Presentation Award for early-year students at the University of Arizona and a 1,400 USD institutional Research Grant. 

The Orangesoft Women in Technology Scholarship would support my endeavors by providing me with the financial resources to continue my research and community engagements. Moreover, it would also symbolize an affirmation of the values of diversity and inclusion that I hold dear. I am eager to contribute further to my field and to continue to advocate for diversity and inclusion throughout my career. Thank you for considering my application. I am both honored and excited to be considered for the Orangesoft Women in Technology Scholarship.

Warm regards,
Yinqi Huang
